# To do

- Re-factor, review comments, and pragma mark properly
- Add unit tests
- Test app in different phone sizes
- Review codebase, memory leaks, use static analyzer

- QA and fix any bugs
- Consider moving back and forward buttons in web view controller to the navigation bar from the bottom bar
- Show user where in the news scrolling he is at (how many has he scrolled, how many more items there are)
- When user reaches the end of scroll view, automatically loads new items
- Persist user's entered search keywords and show a history

- Look into a more fun or more comprehensive API instead of Guardian
